# Leap-Frog-Parkour-Masters
leap frog parkour masters assignment 

Iterations made (as of 2/26) 
- added more obstacles to the environment for the "frogs" to avoid
- played around with gravity, it didn't end up working how I wanted it to so I reverted those changes
- i also played around with having a limited amount of jumps per "frog" but I think I'll incorporate those changes when I add in power ups (like an extra jump collectable)
